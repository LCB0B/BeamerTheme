# üçÉ SimplePlus Beamer Theme

The SimplePlus Beamer Theme is a simple and clear template designed for academic and scientific presentations. It has been modified from the [SimpleDarkBlue](https://github.com/PM25/SimpleDarkBlue-BeamerTheme) Beamer Theme and offers a more minimalist approach to presentation design.

You can find the SimplePlus Beamer Theme on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/simpleplus-beamertheme/wfmfjhdcrdfx) or [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamertheme-simpleplus).
